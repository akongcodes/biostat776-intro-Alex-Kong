### "Oh hi, I didn't see you there."
One might assume that because I am the son of a computer science professor, I would have the computational capacity of at least a small child delighting themselves for the first time with a Raspberry Pi at the tender age of 5. One would assume incorrectly.

Instead of following in my father's footsteps, I blazed my own path, earning a PharmD and MPhil in Pharmacology before pursuing issues related to global health and health policy as a researcher at the Access to Medicine Foundation for two years. I have since resigned myself to being in school for eternity and am currently in my 9th year of higher education as a second-year PhD student in the Department of International Health. There, I hope to explore issues related to access to innovative health technologies, research and development for neglected diseases, and how to create HTML files the right way instead of copying them in the local folder and renaming them.

### Five fun facts about me
1. I have been bucked by a camel in the Sahara Desert.
2. I was in a university a cappella group for four years, in the tender (and brief) time period when a cappella was cool(ish).
3. My parents once tried to bribe my siblings and me with 24K gold coints as a way to convince us to marry Chinese people. They have since denied this.
4. I got into baking after realizing how similar it was to the experiments I was running in lab, except baking usually works, and I can eat the products without violating OSHA regulations.
5. When I was younger, I wanted to be an artist, but my parents said I would end up on the streets begging for money. I did not become an artist.

### One fun thing you should check out
In the early days of the pandemic, I discovered a fantastic British comedy game show called "Taskmaster" that I'm determined to share with as many people as possible. The premise is simple: five comedians compete to complete tasks given to them by the Taskmaster and the Taskmaster's assistant. At the end of each task, the Taskmaster doles out points for the best performances, and the winner of each episode takes home a collection of sometimes embarassing, sometimes surprisingly expensive, and sometimes high octane prizes. 

There are now 11 series of this show, and I watched all of them in the last year. If you're ever feeling down about the pandemic, graduate school, or your inability to code (I'm right there with you), I recommend popping on an episode or five and focusing on the more important questions in life. Like **how to make the most exotic sandwich.**
